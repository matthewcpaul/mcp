<p>Studio was built as an electron app and shipped as a desktop experience, so there wasn’t much of complimentary web experience; just a presentation mode and the ability to leave comments. When I joined InVision, I was working as the Design DRI across three squads responsible for Craft &amp; Web Protototyping, the web Studio Document Viewer, and Inspect for both Sketch and Studio. It was nice to be able to touch such a breadth of the product surface area in my first few months.</p>

<p>When we hired two more designers, my sole focus turned to the Inspect developer experience for this project. With the other teams I worked with, along with the Inspect team, we saw a large opportunity to build the beginnings of Studio in the Browser, starting with showcasing a highlight of the design tool—advanced UI animation capabilities.</p>
