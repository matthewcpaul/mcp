<p>Studio was built as an electron app and shipped as a desktop experience, so there wasnâ€™t much of complimentary web experience; just a presentation mode and the ability to leave comments. When I joined InVision, I was working as the Design DRI across three squads responsible for Craft &amp; Web Protototyping, the web Studio Document Viewer, and Inspect for both Sketch and Studio. It was nice to be able to touch such a breadth of the product surface area in my first few months.</p>

<p>While we hired two more designers, my sole focus turned to the Inspect developer experience for this project.</p>
