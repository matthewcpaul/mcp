<p>Studio was built as an electron app and shipped as a desktop experience, so there wasn’t much of complimentary web experience; just a presentation mode and the ability to leave comments. At the time, I was working as the Design DRI across three squads responsible for Craft &amp; Web Protototyping, the web Studio Document Viewer, and Inspect for both Sketch and Studio. It was nice to be able to touch such a breadth of the product surface area in my first few months.</p>

<p>When we hired two more designers, my sole focus turned to the Inspect developer experience for this project. Along with the other teams I worked with, particularly the Inspect team, we saw a large opportunity to build the beginnings of Studio in the Browser. We collectively decided to start with showcasing a highlight of Studio as a design tool—advanced UI animation capabilities.</p>

<p>The second opporunity we idetified was that we had a chance to build a developer tool that hasn’t ever existed before. This meant we had a chance to innovate and to do all of the product strategy, generative research, prototyping and sketching ideas, user story maps, product roadmap, refining the design, customer research, build the tool along the way, and eventually release the large feature. This also meant that it was an important strategic project for the company.</p>

<p>When I joined InVision in 2018, I learned that a number of ideas, projects, and time had already been spent on bringing complex motion capabilities to the product offering. One being “Motion”, which they were attenpting to build into the web app prototyping experience; another being a pivot all togeher to build a full-blown desktop design tool with unprecidented motion capabilities and granular control. This was Studio.</p>

<p>The Inspect team was challened with deconstructing what we had now, which was for the creator, and figure out how to best deliver all kinds of motion data to the developer—the reader.What should the product be? Where should it fit within InVision’s new v7 platform? What were the pertinent peieces of data that developers needed, and what was just fluff? Could we build it into the presentation mode’s Inspect feature? Would the user’s flow, interactions, and information architecture make sense in that model?</p>

<p>It was time to do some research and making.</p>

<p>We began by looking at the recent history of design tools, other animation and video editing tools, and even tools from the music industry, like Ableton and Pro Tools. Once we felt like we gathered enough information, talked with a handful of InVision customers, and shared our insights with leadership, I began designing iteration after iteration based on what we knew at that point.</p>

<p>We (the Inspect team) felt good about the direction, and began putting mockups and animated prototypes in front of internal software engineers who use Inspect in their daily work. We also repeated the same sharing process with the designers and leadership who have been working on Studio for the past 2.5–3 years. The prototypes and direction was well recieved, and we felt comfortable coding a rough version of the product and testing it with real users.</p>
