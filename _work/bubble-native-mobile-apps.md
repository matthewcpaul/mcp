description-1: I led design for a 0–1 product offering within the existing no-code Bubble platform for building fully functioning web applications—the Native Mobile Apps editor. I researched the native mobile app development domain, designed the largest largest product expansion in Bubble’s history, and collaborated with the engineers to build and launch the private Beta release.
description-2: This tool enabled new and existing Bubble customers from differing user profiles to build fully functioning native mobile apps. We left no stone unturned when it came to every small detail, giving users the tools to build with actual native mobile navigation patterns and components, and to publish their apps to the Apple App Store & Google Play Store; without writing a single line of code.
