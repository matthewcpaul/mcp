description: I led design for a 0–1 product offering within the existing no-code Bubble platform for building fully functioning web applications—the Native Mobile Apps editor. I designed and collaborated with the engineers to build the Native Mobile Apps Private Beta. This Private Beta enabled a select set of customers, from differing user profiles, to build fully functioning native mobile apps (powered by React Native) with all of the common native mobile navigation patterns and components, and publish their apps to the Apple App Store & Google Play Store.
