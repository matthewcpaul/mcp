description-1: I led design for a 0–1 product offering within the existing no-code Bubble platform for building fully functioning web applications—the Native Mobile Apps editor. I researched the native mobile app development domain, designed the largest largest product expansion in Bubble’s history, and collaborated with the engineers to build and launch the private Beta release.
description-2: This tool enabled new and existing Bubble customers from differing user profiles to build fully functioning native mobile apps. We left no stone unturned when it came to every small detail, giving users the tools to build with actual native mobile navigation patterns and components, and to publish their apps to the Apple App Store & Google Play Store; without writing a single line of code.

### Build the foundation of you app with the native App Bar
Use the editor to design and build your apps with the most common mobile native navigation pattern, which is adaptive for both iOS and Android. Customize the title style, add leading and trailing actions, and style any property to fit your brand.

### Build mobile navigation with the native Tab Bar
Decide which views you want to be the root views in the bottom Tab Bar, customize the icons, labels, & active / inactive colors, and easily create & rearrange Tab Items directly from the property editor.

### Publish a new version, or OTA update to both app stores
With the current infrastructure of the Bubble platform, when you deploy a new version of your mobile app, both the web app and native mobile app are deployed at the same time. For native mobile, you can choose between an OTA (over the air) update or a new version—in which you can choose major, minor, or patch, and Bubble handles the semantic versioning for you.
