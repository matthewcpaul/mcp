tenure: '2018'
description: IBM made a sizeable investment in design at the end of 2013 to rebuild the company’s products and services across the business. I joined during the first year of this transformation, and partnered with various organizations to define product strategy, facilitate workshops, research user needs, design enterprise software, and collaborate with engineers to continuously deliver outcomes.
intro: During my time at IBM, I had the fantastic opportunity to work with a wide variety of business units and product teams. From Enterprise Content Management to internal DevOps tools, and AI chatbots to design systems, I learned what it was like to design, build, and ship highly secure software at scale.

    <p>Watson Assistant is a conversation AI platform that helps provide fast, straightforward, and accurate answers to your customer’s questions by addressing common customer inquiries.</p>
    <p>While working with the IBM Support team, I helped establish the initial chatbot experience by defining conversational design principles. This included a visual and motion design system to provide appropriate feedback during the experience, using the newly rolled-out <a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/" target="_blank">Carbon</a> component library.</p>

    <p>A conscious and unique decision we landed on was differentiating the messages from Watson Assistant and the human interacting with it. We wanted to clarify when people chat with the AI assistant versus an actual support staff member.</p>
    <p>This solution ultimately came from various motion experiments for the loading state (“Watson is responding”). The vertical pulsing of the dots seamlessly transitions into the pill avatar.</p>

    <p>The IBM Design Language began with a few base resources: fonts, colors, and icons. Different IBM businesses built on top of this by creating and maintaining design guides specific to their needs. These systems worked well for their products but didn’t give designers the tools to prototype vastly new interfaces.</p>
    <p>Product Designers work in various capacities in the product lifecycle at IBM and are expected to realize and test big ideas quickly. To empower them to prototype at the pace required, a functional SCSS component library was needed, along with the means to test and deploy their work to production without help from engineers.</p>

    <p>The CSS architecture of Rapid is based around a combination of ITCSS, BEM name-spacing, and Atomic/Functional CSS, with the core goal of using SCSS to its full potential to make a tool that could strike a balance between strict consistency and flexibility.</p>

    <p>A design system, or any tool, is only as good as its documentation.

This meant using comments in the SCSS code to generate portions of the documentation and letting the component code shine.</p>

    <p>While working with and mentoring other product designers, I learned that there’s a big gap between knowing HTML/CSS and shipping a testable, interactive prototype to a production environment.</p>
    <p>To make this tool fully usable, I created a basic project scaffold that uses Nunjucks, Armadillo static site generator, and Rapid, then wrapped that into a Yeoman Generator that also sets up a GitHub Enterprise Repository connected to Travis CI for automated testing and automated deploys.</p>
    <p>This is all done securely behind IBM’s firewall, using the designer’s w3id login credentials at project setup. Both Rapid and the Rapid Generator are deployed to IBM’s NPM Enterprise, ready for anyone to consume.</p>
