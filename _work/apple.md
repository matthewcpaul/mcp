description: I spent 3 months in Cupertino, CA, working with the talented team at Apple to concept, design, and partner with engineering on both the “Built-in Apps” and “Custom Apps” for their <a href="https://www.apple.com/business/products-platform/" target="_blank">Apple at Work</a> program. We explored ways to extend the iOS ecosystem for people at work in a historically individual-use, consumer-first product company.
