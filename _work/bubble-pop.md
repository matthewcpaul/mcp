description-1: When I joined Bubble, they had only just started a component library effort, and I led the design of a powerful new design system in Figma and in code. With “Editor Modernization” being one of the company’s top priorities, and with a design team that grew from 2 to 10 within a year, the team needed someone experienced in design systems both from the design and craft angle, and the technical architecture side.
description-2: This new and growing design system provides a comprehensive set of design foundations and tokens, icons, standard and uniquely complex components, design guidelines, contribution models, PR review processes, and documentation that empowers Bubble’s software engineers and product designers to build polished and consistent interfaces that align with the company’s evolving brand and product direction.

## Where design and engineering intersect
The contributions to the Pop design system was a distributed collaboration between a few designers and some engineers on each team that I oversaw and directly contributed to. My favorite thing about design systems is the inherent way it fosters deep collaboration between designers and engineers to bring resilience and speed to the product development process.
