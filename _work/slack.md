description: IBM was one of the first customers to roll out Slack’s enterprise product offering, and my team was responsible for building tooling that filled gaps in that experience. The biggest need was to enable users that were split between hundreds of Slack Workspaces to find and communicate with each other. We designed an experience called Discoverable Teams for employees at IBM, which was a catalyst for Slack’s eventual in-app solution.
