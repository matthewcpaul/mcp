title: Slack Enterprise for IBM
role: Product Designer
tenure: 2016
description: IBM was one of the first customers to roll out Slack’s enterprise product offering. We designed an experience called Discoverable Teams—allowing users that were split between hundreds of Slack Workspaces to find and communicate with each other—which became a catalyst for Slack’s eventual in-app solution.
