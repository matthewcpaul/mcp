description: IBM was one of the first customers to roll out Slack’s enterprise product offering, and my team focused on gaps in that experience. We designed an experience called Discoverable Teams—allowing users that were split between hundreds of Slack Workspaces to find and communicate with each other—which became a catalyst for Slack’s eventual in-app solution.
