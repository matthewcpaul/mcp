description-1: I was the Senior Product Designer on the Inspect team, and redesigned the entire Inspect UI, Selection Mechanics, and Asset Manager as a part of our larger effort of redesigning the cloud platform from the ground up. I also led the design of a 0–1 tool called Inspect Motion; a type of designer/developer collaboration tool that had never existeed in our industry before.
description-2: Inspect Motion allows developers to find every detail—start and end values, duration, delay, and easing curve—for any animating property on any element from the designer’s prototype. To enable this redesign and new product vertical, I designed and re-factored large portions of the Helios design system; also defining processes, managing contributions, and helping to implement a tool for measuring system adoption.
