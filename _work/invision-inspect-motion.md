description: I was the Senior Product Designer on the Inspect team, and redesigned the entire Inspect UI, Selection Mechanics, and Asset Manager as a part of our larger effort of redesigning the cloud platform from the ground up. I also led the design of a 0–1 tool called Inspect Motion; a type of designer/developer collaboration tool that had never existeed in our industry before.
intro: Inspect Motion allows developers to find every detail—start and end values, duration, delay, and easing curve—for any animating property on any element in the designer’s prototype. To enable this work, I designed and re-factored large portions of the Helios design system; also defining processes, managing contributions, and helping to implement a tool for measuring system adoption.
