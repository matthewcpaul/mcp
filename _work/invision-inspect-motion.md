description: How can we advance design and prototyping tools to help drive whole-team collaboration for software teams worldwide? My work at InVision involved rethinking the entire developer experience, conducting research sessions with the industry’s leading software teams, evolving our design system, and prototyping new products while improving existing features.
intro: The lines between engineering, product, and design are ever more blurred, and every product org operates uniquely. The most valuable part of working at InVision was talking with all of these various design teams, learning what was and wasn’t working for them, and challenging ourselves to build systems and tools to push the software industry forward.
