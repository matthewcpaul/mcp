## Opportunity
Studio was built as an electron app and shipped as a desktop experience, so there wasn’t much of complimentary web experience; just a presentation mode and the ability to leave comments. When I joined InVision, I was working as the Design DRI across three squads responsible for Craft & Web Protototyping, the web Studio Document Viewer, and Inspect for both Sketch and Studio. It was nice to be able to touch such a breadth of the product surface area in my first few months.

When we hired two more designers, my sole focus turned to the Inspect developer experience for this project. With the other teams I worked with, along with the Inspect team, we saw a large opportunity to build the beginnings of Studio in the Browser, starting with showcasing a highlight of the design tool—advanced UI animation capabilities.

The second opporunity we idetified was that we had a chance to build a developer tool that hasn’t ever existed before. This meant we had a chance to innovate and to do all of the product strategy, generative research, prototyping and sketching ideas, user story maps, product roadmap, refining the design, customer research, build the tool along the way, and eventually release the large feature. This also meant that it was an important strategic project for the company.
