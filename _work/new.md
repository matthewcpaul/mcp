role: Senior & Staff Product Designer
tenure: 2020–2022
description: The past two years have been a mix of joining two seed-stage startups as a founding designer—QA Wolf & The.com; and independent contracting with companies such as OpenTable, Handshake, Slice, and other fast-growing, larger startups. I've collected a few case studies of work that I’m proud of from these opportunities as Figma decks that play as a prorotype would. Hit ‘right-arrow’ and you should be okay.
