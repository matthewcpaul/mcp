role: Senior Product Designer, Founding Designer
tenure: 2020–2023
description: I joined two seed-stage startups as the Founding Designer—QA Wolf & The.com—and did independent contracting as a Senior Product Designer with companies such as OpenTable, Handshake, and other larger startups. I’ve curated a few case studies of work from these roles into Figma presentations that play as a prototype would in their Present mode. Tap those ‘right- and left-arrow’ keys and you should be good to go.
