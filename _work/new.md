description: The past two years have been a mix of joining two seed-stage startups as the founding designer—QA Wolf & The.com—and independent contracting with companies such as OpenTable, Handshake, and other larger startups. I’ve collected a few case studies of work that I’m proud of from these opportunities as Figma decks that play as a prototype would in their Present mode. Tap those ‘right- and left-arrow’ keys and you should be good to go.
