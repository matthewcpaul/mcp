role: Senior & Staff Product Designer
tenure: 2020–2022
description: The past two years have been a mix of joining two seed-stage startups as the founding designer—QA Wolf & The.com—and independent contracting with companies such as OpenTable, Handshake, and other high-growth, larger startups. I’ve collected a few case studies of work that I’m proud of from these opportunities as Figma decks that play as a prototype would (two more coming Feb, 2023). Hit the ‘right-arrow’ key and you should be good to go.
