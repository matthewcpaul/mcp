role: Senior & Staff Product Designer
tenure: 2020–2022
description: The past two years have been a mix of joining two early, seed-stage startups as a founding designer—QA Wolf & The.com; and independent contract work with companies such as OpenTable, Handshake, and other small startups. I have collected work that I’m proud of from these experiences as Figma decks. Hit ‘right-arrow’ and you should be okay.
