role: Lead Product Designer
tenure: 2023–2024
description: I led product design for a 0–1 product within the existing no-code platform for building fully functioning web applications on Bubble—the Native Mobile Apps editor/designer & app store(s) publish experience. I designed and collaborated with the engineers the Private Beta experience. This Private Beta enabled a select set of customers, from differing user profiles, to build fully functioning native mobile apps (powered by React Native), with all of the common native mobile navigation patterns and components, and publish their apps to the Apple App Store & Google Play Store.
