description-1: I led product, design, and design systems for this 14 person startup. The.com is a no- to low-code sheet-based website builder and CMS tool. I helped them learn from their existing customers through generative and evaluative research, iterate and improve on their core product, and design a completely new feature & product surface area called Page Generation.
description-2: I also designed and helped engineer a design system from scratch—typography and type scales, 0–10 color ramps, spacing units, iconography, and complex components—in both Figma and React. The Page Generation project enabled the team to sign big-name customers such as Adobe and Ramp, and succesfully find product-market fit.

### Manage all of your single and generated pages in one place
Use the pages menu to add, select, edit, or close any page of your website. This one-stop shop allows you to create new one-off pages or auto-generated pages, and easily navigate through your workflow.

### Customize your view for how you like to work
Work side-by-side, collapse the sheet to see a full view of the selected page, or collapse the page to focus on the sheet. And use the view switcher to change the orientation between left, right, or top-and-bottom.

## Why did we build this?
### The Problem
In the previous iteration of the product, users didn’t have a way to work see both the pages they were designing and the content they were creating in a single view. This led to a constant back-and-forth, forcing them to completely switch contexts when wanting to make edits to the design and edits to the content. Furthermore, when a user wanted to work on the content in the sheet, they had to navigate back to another view and then search for and open the corresponding sheet. It was a clunky user experience that needed a complete overhaul.

There also was’t a way to create page templates and use the power of the the spreadsheet-as-a-CMS model to generate multiple pages quickly. Users could only create one-off pages, and then duplicate them as completely separate pages with corresponding sheets.

### Constraints and opportunities
I created a series of surveys to identify pain points and set up interviews with our early users of the product to see firsthand how they navigated through and worked with the as-is expereince. This rapid research was invaluable in helping give more shape to the problem and identify constraints & opportunity areas.

1. Seeing both the CMS sheet or the editor sheet, along with the page the user is working on is a must have
1. Even with the CMS sheets as panels instead of their own full-page view, the sheets should still have their full capabilities, which required rearchitecting in how they were built
1. The editor experience should feel more configurable and cater to how different users want to work; people prefer different setups and layouts when doing this type of web design and content management work
1. Horizontal space in the bottom toolbar was becoming a problem, and needed to be addressed
