description-1: In late 2021, I worked with OpenTable as an independent contractor to design a new tool for restaurant owners and operators that allowed them to create and manage automated guest tags. These tags can be configured by any kind of business rules and criteria that would then automatically be added to the restaurant guest’s profile once the criteria was met by that guest.
description-2: For example, “If a guest orders more than one bottle of wine, each over $60.00 USD, on four consecutive visits, add the ‘Wine Connoisseur’ tag”, which the front-of-house staff will see in the guest’s profile on their next visit; along with a description to instruct the waiter to bring the guest their favorite bottle of wine free of charge.

## Product Preview

- single or 3 vignettes with motion & no explanation/words

## What wasn’t working?
### The Problem
Restaurant Operators are not able to create and manage automated customer intel on their own based on visits, spending habits, and other business rules & criteria, so that they can identify all loyal guests—not just the ones they notice or remember—to provide a personalized guest experience and exceptional hospitality for everyone.

## Generative Research
- Understanding the as-is tag taxonomy
- What are example guest tags?
- SME Interviews
- As-is journey mapping

### Key findings; How did this make our users feel?

## Opportunities
<!-- - Impact/Importance matrix (would need to make; for OpenTable, we used the user story mapping and star stickers to kind of do this) -->
### Hypothesis
<!-- - HMW questions (not used in this project) -->
What are the users expectations of how this should work? (easy enough to write something for this project—what did we know they expected at this point?)
### To-be user story mapping
### Define what success looks like

## Explore & experiment
- Navigation & information architecture audit & redesign
- User flow first draft
- Restaurant or Tag first?

## Prototyping
- First prototype & learnings
- Second prototype & learnings
- Third prototype & learnings

### Effortlessly create automated tags
Choose a pre-defined tag type, configure and customize the critera based on whatever business rules you’d like, and assign the new automated tag to all of your restaurants or specific locations.

### Get a birds-eye view of all your restaurants and tags
Filter to any restaurant or sub-restaurant of your larger organization in the Client Admin section of the platform, and update, add, or delete the hundreds of automated tags that you’re managing.

### Retire seasonal promotions or experimental deals
Using data elsewhere in the OpenTable for Restaurants platform, you can determine if you want to keep or delete any automated tags—and the deals or extra attention to service that comes with them—any time.
