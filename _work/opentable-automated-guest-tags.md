description-1: In late 2021, I worked with OpenTable as an independent contractor to design a new tool for restaurant owners and operators that allowed them to create and manage automated guest tags. These tags can be configured by any kind of business rules and criteria that would then automatically be added to the restaurant guest’s profile once the criteria was met by that guest.
description-2: For example, “If a guest orders more than one bottle of wine, each over $60.00, on four consecutive visits, add the ‘Wine Connoisseur’ tag”, which the front-of-house staff will see in the guest’s profile on their next visit; and the ‘Wine Connoisseur’ tag can have a description to instruct the waiter to bring the guest their favorite bottle of wine free of charge.

## Product Preview
- single or 3 vignettes with motion & no explanation/words

## The problem

## Generative Research
- SME Interviews
- Understanding the as-is tag taxonomy
- What are example guest tags?

## How did this make users feel? Or, What were the key findings?

## As-is journey mapping

## Opportunities
- Impact/Importance matrix (would need to make; for OpenTable, we used the user story mapping and star stickers to kind of do this)
- Hypothesis
- HMW questions (not used in this project)
- What are the users expectations of how this should work? (easy enough to write something for this project—what did we know they expected at this point?)
- Define what success looks like

## To-be user story mapping

## Explore & experiment
- Navigation & information architecture
- User flow first draft
- Restaurant or Tag first?

## Prototype
- First prototype & learnings
- Second prototype & learnings
- Third prototype & learnings

## What we launched
- Final design and prototype & what the final changes were
- Show 2 or 3 prototype video vignettes that highlight the biggest wins

## Impact / What difference did we make?
