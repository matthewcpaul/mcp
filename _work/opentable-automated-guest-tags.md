description-1: In late 2021, I worked with OpenTable as an independent contractor to design a new tool for restaurant owners and operators that allowed them to create and manage automated guest tags. These tags can be configured by any kind of business rules and criteria that would then automatically be added to the restaurant guest’s profile once the criteria was met by that guest.
description-2: For example, “If a guest orders more than one bottle of wine, each over $60.00 USD, on four consecutive visits, add the ‘Wine Connoisseur’ tag”, which the front-of-house staff will see in the guest’s profile on their next visit; along with a description to instruct the waiter to bring the guest their favorite bottle of wine free of charge.
