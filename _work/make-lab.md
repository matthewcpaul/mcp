description: In an increasingly digital world, the practice of working with the your hands is more crucial than ever. I co-founded the Make Lab with <a href="https://www.patrickchew.com/">Patrick Chew</a> in 2014 to create a space where IBMers could explore, iterate, fail, recharge, and learn together. We built a dedicated space for printmaking, circuitry, 3D printing, and other forms of physical making. In 2017, I designed and built a couple websites for our program and archives.
