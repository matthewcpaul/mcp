description: In an increasingly digital world, unplugging and working with the your hands is more important than ever. I co-founded the Make Lab with <a href="https://www.patrickchew.com/">Patrick Chew</a> in 2014 to create a space where IBMers could explore, recharge, and bring that creative energy back to their work. We built a dedicated space for physical making, taught printmaking classes, managed monthly budgets, and built the Lab’s web archives.
