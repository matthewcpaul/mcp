description: How can we advance design and prototyping tools to help drive whole-team collaboration for software teams around the world? My work at InVision involved rethinking the entire developer experience, conducting research sessions with the industry’s leading software teams, evolving our design system, and prototyping new products while improving existing features.

intro: The lines between engineering, product, and design are ever more blurred, and every product org operates uniquely. The best part of working at InVision was talking with all of these various design teams, learning what was and wasn’t working for them, and challenging ourselves to build systems and tools to push the software industry forward.

  <h2>Mobile Prototype Viewer</h2>
  <article class="c-grid__mt c-text-format">
    <p>The first project I worked on was a redesign of the prototype overview and previewer. The previous experience was nearly six years old, wasn’t mobile-friendly, and lacked proper navigation. Additionally, Studio introduced a wider range of appearance settings, like device skins, various dimensions, and auto-scaling, making the viewing experience unpredictable across devices.</p>
    <p>We started by testing every possible scenario of how various prototypes — watch, phone, tablet, desktop — were being presented in a mobile browser, and created a survey to gather the preferences of 2,000+ customers.</p>
    <p>The results of this research led us to design a matrix of sensible defaults, and a simple interaction allowing the viewer to toggle between the creator-defined setting and an auto-scale override.</p>

    <p>We also used this as an opportunity to design a new mobile navigation that allowed the viewer to move between screens in a prototype and navigate back to the screens overview at any time. It seems obvious, but neither of these options previously existed on mobile. The navigation is a handy way for stakeholders that are not yet familiarized with the clickable prototype.</p>

  <h2>Inspect for Studio</h2>
  <article class="c-grid__mt c-text-format">
    <p>Next, we surfaced more of the Studio design file on the web by rethinking the Inspect product from the ground up. InVision already had an Inspect feature for Sketch &amp; Craft users, but it struggled to meet the growing demands of developers and was brimming with bugs. This was an exercise in listening to both what data they needed and what features were getting in the way. We rearchitected the information design to account for any future properties that might be added to Studio, and redesigned the product to allow developers to spend less time in our app, and more time building theirs.</p>

  <h2>Inspect Motion</h2>
  <article class="c-grid__mt c-text-format">
    <p>With the advent of <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/studio" target="_blank">InVision Studio</a>, designers and other creatives were given the ability to create complex UI animations with granular control over every property. They can even customize duration, delay, and easing for any property as well. The result was some of the most beautiful and thoughtful animated prototypes our industry had seen—one’s that you could actually click or tap through on any device (not just watch a movie of something created in After Effects).</p>
    <p>Working with the Inspect team, we were challenged with creating a tool that allowed developers to collaborate with designers on these animated prototypes; they needed to inspect each and every motion detail so they could bring it to life in code. We identified an opportunity to build a developer tool that hadn’t ever existed before. This allowed me to contribute to the entire product lifecycle — the product strategy, generative research, ideation, prototyping, refining of the design, user story mapping, building the tool along the way, usability testing, and eventually release the large feature.</p>

    <p>We continued to iterate on this feature after running usability tests with customers in which we had them use a beta release of the app to program some motion into a CodePen demo that we pre-coded to exactly match the Studio prototype. Through these sessions, we quickly learned that developers wanted code snippets as a starting place, and not just the data-list view. Inspect Motion provides starter motion code for most properties in CSS, Objective-C, Swift, Anroid, or React Native.</p>

    <p>From the beginning, we knew that we needed to build this tool with keyboard-only users in mind. Inspect Motion is optimized for efficiency with keyboard shortcuts for navigation, canvas selection, traversing the timeline, and motion playback.</p>

  <h2>Design System</h2>
  <article class="c-grid__mt c-text-format">
    <p>After a few feature and product launches, I was asked to take on extra responsibility and be the design system partner for all of InVision’s web properties to help make sure each team’s needs were being met. We began having “Helios Office Hours” every other week, and I eventually led an extensive audit and refactor of the system’s typography, spacing units, and common component sizes. I also contributed many new icons to the system and helped build a Studio library and corresponding React Storybook of UI elements for my specific product area.</p>
