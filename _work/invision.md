description: I’m currently a design lead for InVision Inspect. We’re building tools to encourage systematic collaboration between designers and engineers. I’m working on bringing the product up to market expectations, integrating with more of InVision’s connected workflow, and thinking of how we support engineers beyond initial design deliverables.
