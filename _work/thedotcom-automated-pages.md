description-1: I led product, design, and design systems for this 14 person startup. The.com is a no- to low-code sheet-based website builder and CMS tool. I helped them learn from their existing customers through generative and evaluative research, iterate and improve on their core product, and design a completely new feature & product surface area called Page Automation.
description-2: 'I also designed and helped engineer a design system from scratch—typography and type scales, 0–10 color ramps for every main hue, spacing units, iconography, and complex components & patterns—in both Figma and React. My work directly led to them landing big-name customers, and finding product-market fit that is now their core business: Page Automation.'
