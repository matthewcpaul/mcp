How do you become an effective leader when there are many different ways to lead and each of your teammates respond in a unique way?

Learn how to be flexible to meet the needs of others by exploring certain attributes that can be useful in some situations, but detrimental in others. While leading product teams and design thinking workshops at IBM, I’ve found out first-hand how important these soft skills of leadership really are. As leaders, the responsibility and success of the team falls on us. It’s bend or break.

In this workshop, designers will break out into small groups to examine and share different leadership attributes that they struggle with, and then everyone will come together to discuss the top eight attributes of the afternoon in an everybody-stands activity. Come prepared to think introspectively, share with each other, and move around.

You’ll leave with new tips on how to manage specific types of people, and a concrete set of leadership qualities to study up on and bring back to your everyday work.
