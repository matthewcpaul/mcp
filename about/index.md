## Good people

I enjoy working with good people and forming honest relationships. I’m currently living in Brooklyn, NY and building a few things of my own—one OSS project around sensible screen-based media type scales, and two physical products that will be for sale this Summer/Fall. I most recently worked with <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/">IBM</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/business/">Apple at Work</a> before that. I’m a software product designer, researcher, and front-end engineer, which basically means I like making things for other people.
