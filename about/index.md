    <p>Hi, I’m Matthew — a Software Product Designer and Design Engineer with 10+ years of experience leading the design process on product teams, building design systems, and engineering high-craft, high-polish product experiences.</p>
    <p>I believe that building software is a team sport; the best products are built where design and engineering come together, and when work feels like play.</p>
    <p>I most recently spent the last year at <a href="https://www.bubble.io/" target="_blank">Bubble</a>, designing the Native Mobile Apps editor, establishing the foundations of our design system, Pop, as well as designing and building 20+ new components.</p>
    <p>Previously, I was the founding designer for both <a href="https://www.the.com/" target="_blank">The.com</a> and <a href="https://www.qawolf.com/" target="_blank">QA Wolf</a>. Prior to that, I worked on designer / developer tools and design systems at <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/" target="_blank">InVision</a>. I got my start in software at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/" target="_blank">IBM</a>, where I designed a variety of enterprise software products across different organizations. During that time, I also contracted with Apple, where I prototyped apps for the <a href="https://www.apple.com/business/" target="_blank">Apple at work</a> program. In 2014, I co-founded the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/make.lab/" target="_blank">Make Lab</a>, a printmaking space in IBM’s Austin Studio.</p>
