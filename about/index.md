    <h2>Work experience</h2>
    <p>Before OpenTable, I was the founding designer for <a href="https://www.qawolf.com/" target="_blank">QA Wolf</a>. I helped them take their CLI developer tool from 0–1 as a web platform with CI/CD integrations for QA Engineers to automate their end-to-end browser testing. I also designed the documentation website, marketing website, and helped develop their pricing structure that led to their first cohort of paying customers.</p>
    <p>Prior to that, I designed and built tools to improve designer & developer collaboration at <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/" target="_blank">InVision</a>, working across InVision Studio, GitHub & Jira integrations, Inspect, and Inspect Motion.</p>
    <p>I got my start in product design at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/" target="_blank">IBM</a>, where I contributed to many enterprise software product releases across different organizations during my 4.5 year tenure. During that time, I also had the unique opportunity to contract with <a href="https://www.apple.com/business/" target="_blank">Apple</a> in Cupertino where I focused on prototyping apps for the Apple at Work program.</p>
    <p>In 2014, I co-founded the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/make.lab/" target="_blank">Make Lab</a> with a co-worker & friend in Austin, TX.</p>
    <p>If you find yourself in NYC and would like to meet up for a tea, coffee, or snack, <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewcpaul" target="_blank">find me on Twitter</a>.</p>
    <h2>More about me</h2>
    <p>I’m an experienced product designer, responsible for leading the design process on product teams, defining product direction, prioritizing cross-company efforts, and shaping new practices within design organizations.</p>
    <p>As a design generalist, I use a breadth of skills to contribute to the entire product lifecycle — research, ideation, journey mapping, visual &amp; interaction design, prototyping, measuring success, and product marketing.</p>
    <p>I care about why we build things, and the effects of technology on society. It’s our job to consider the impact of every decision we make, and ensure that what’s built is ethical, inclusive, and accessible for anybody to use.</p>
    <h2>Principles</h2>
    <p>Building products and services is a team sport. It requires healthy collaboration, persistent communication, and diversity in people and ideas. I enjoy making tools that help teams be better teams and people be better people.</p>
    <p>Everything we make is a system, whether in-and-of itself or as a part of a larger model. Acknowledging this allows us to think more openly about our work, be responsible &amp; accountable in our execution, and examine how it all fits into the the greatest model of all — the world.</p>
