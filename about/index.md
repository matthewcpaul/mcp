    <h2>Good People</h2>
    <p>I’m a product designer, researcher, and engineer living in Brooklyn, NY. I value people, perpetual learning, and forming honest relationships.</p>
    <p>I believe products are in service of people. It is our job to make sure they are accessible and inclusive for anyone to use.</p>
    <p>I’m currently building a few things of my own — an open-source project around sensible screen-based media type scales, a series of enamel pins and prints, and a mechanical keyboard key set that will be for sale this Fall/Winter. Previously, I built tools for design teams at <a href="https://www.matthewcpaul.com/work/invision/">InVision</a>, designed enterprise software at <a href="https://www.matthewcpaul.com/work/ibm/">IBM</a>, and prototyped apps for people at work with <a href="https://www.apple.com/business/" target="_blank">Apple</a>. In 2014, I founded the <a href="https://www.matthewcpaul.com/work/makelab/">Make Lab</a> with a co-worker in Austin, TX.</p>
