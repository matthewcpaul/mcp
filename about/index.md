    <p>Hi, I’m Matthew — a Software Product Designer and Design Engineer with 10+ of experience leading the design process on product teams, building design systems, engineering high-craft, high-polish product experiences, defining product direction, prioritizing cross-company efforts, and shaping new practices within design organizations.</p>
    <p>I believe that building software is a team sport; the best products are built where design and engineering come together, and when work feels like play.</p>
    <p>I most recently spent the last year at <a href="https://www.bubble.io/" target="_blank">Bubble</a>, designing the Native Mobile Apps proudct offering, and establishing the foundations of our design system, Pop, as well as designing and helping build 20+ new components.</p>
    <p>Previously, I was the founding designer for both <a href="https://www.the.com/" target="_blank">The.com</a> and <a href="https://www.qawolf.com/" target="_blank">QA Wolf</a>. Prior to that, I worked on design & developer tools and design systems at <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/" target="_blank">InVision</a>. I got my start in software product design at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/" target="_blank">IBM</a>, where I contributed to a variety of enterprise software products across different organizations during my four-and-a-half-year tenure. During that time, I also had the unique opportunity to contract with Apple, where I focused on prototyping apps for the <a href="https://www.apple.com/business/" target="_blank">Apple at work</a> program. In 2014, I co-founded the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/make.lab/" target="_blank">Make Lab</a> with a co-worker & friend in Austin, TX.</p>
