    <h2>Good People</h2>
    <p>I’m a product designer, researcher, and engineer living in Brooklyn, NY. I value human connection, perpetual learning, and metaphors that guide our everyday interactions.</p>
    <p>I believe products are in service of people. It is our job to make sure they are accessible and inclusive for anyone to use.</p>
    <p>I’m currently building a few things of my own — an open-source project around sensible screen-based media type scales, a series of enamel pins and prints, and a mechanical keyboard key set that will be for sale this Fall/Winter. Previously, I built tools for design teams at <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>, designed enterprise software at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/">IBM</a>, and prototyped apps for people at work with <a href="https://www.apple.com/business/" target="_blank">Apple</a>. In 2014, I founded the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/make.lab/">Make Lab</a> with a co-worker in Austin, TX.</p>
    <p>I enjoy meeting new people. If you find yourself in one of the five boroughs and would like to meet up for a tea, coffee, or snack, please <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewcpaul" target="_blank">reach out on Twitter</a>!</p>
