role: Product Designer &amp; Front-end Engineer
description: <a class="c-work__case-study-ibm" href="https://www.ibm.com/design/">IBM</a> made a strong investment in design at the end of 2013 to rebuild the companyâ€™s products and services across the business. I joined during the first year of this transformation, and partnered with various organizations to define product strategy, research user needs, design enterprise software, and collaborate with engineers while continuously delivering outcomes for the business. My largest contribution was shipping an experience that allowed team leaders and financial analysts to manage access and payments for strategic, third-party tools.
