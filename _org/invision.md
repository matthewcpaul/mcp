description: I joined <a class="c-work__case-study-invision" href="https://www.invisionapp.com/studio">InVision</a> in 2018 to fucs on the developer experience. I lead the Inspect team, and supported Design Systems Manager and Studio Cloud. We were responsible for delivering new experiences and improving existing features that helped software design and engineering teams around the world. In addition to product team work, I operated as the internal design system partner. I made sure every delivery teamâ€™s systems needs were met through bi-weekly office hours, contributed new components and icons, and led a large refactor of spacing and component sizes to set up all future teams for success.
