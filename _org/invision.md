description: I joined <a class="c-work__case-study-invision" href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a> in 2018 to focus on the developer experience. I led the <a class="c-work__case-study-invision" href="https://www.invisionapp.com/feature/inspect">Inspect</a> team, and supported the <a class="c-work__case-study-invision" href="https://www.invisionapp.com/design-system-manager">Design System Manager</a> and <a class="c-work__case-study-invision" href="https://www.invisionapp.com/studio">Studio Cloud</a> products. We were responsible for delivering new experiences and improving existing features that helped software design and engineering teams around the world. In addition to product team work, I operated as the internal design system partner. I made sure every delivery teamâ€™s needs were met through bi-weekly office hours, contributed new components and icons, and led a large refactor of spacing and component sizes to set up all future teams for success.
