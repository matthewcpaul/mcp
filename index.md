### Product Designer and Engineer

#### Description  

I’m Matthew—a designer with a focus on software products, design systems, interaction design, and prototyping. I work with researchers, engineers, and product managers to lead product strategy and create accessible software that captivates users while exceeding business goals.

I’m currently working at [IBM](http://www.ibm.com/us-en/), in Austin, on the enterprise software support experience. I’m also growing the [IBM Make Lab](https://www.instagram.com/make.lab/), managing our quarterly budget, teaching others the art of printmaking, and fostering better craft at our different IBM Studios worldwide.
